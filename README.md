## 📖 Description  

**OXO (Tic-Tac-Toe)** is a console game in **Java** where 2 players face off in a game of tic-tac-toe.  
The goal is to align as many X's or O's as there are rows and columns on the board. Each player must input the coordinates of a cell to mark on each turn, with visual indicators to track the progress of the game.

1. **Start the game** : After running the program, you will be prompted to enter the name of each player and the size of the board.  
2. **Making a move** : On each turn, input the coordinates of the cell where you want to place your mark.  
3. **Progress** : The board will display the game state after each move, with a visual representation to follow the progress.  
4. **Victory** : The first player to align X's or O's as per the board size wins the game !
